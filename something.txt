Kim Ha-seong comes out on top in Korean MLB clash.

Kim Kwang-hyun and Kim Ha-seong faced off on Sunday as the St. Louis Cardinals took on the San Diego Padres at Pepco Park in San Diego, a rare example of a Korean pitcher facing a Korean batter in the big leagues.
The Padres won the game 5-3 to sweep the series at home, following a big 13-3 victory on Saturday and 5-4 win on Friday. 
Fireworks didn't exactly fly in the Kim vs. Kim faceoff, 
but it was Kim Ha-seong who came out on top, drawing an RBI walk in the fourth inning that ended Kim Kwang-hyun's game early
